hyper black jack?

first level is one d normal game of black jack

second level uses two dimensions

when you hit you may add in the horizontal or vertical direction, 

at each stage your cards cannot go over 21*stage and cannot go over 21 in each direction.  whoever gets closest to 21*stage wins.

problem here is how to make the computer play.

using 1 deck...
player rules: deal them two cards in each direction
ask them if they want to hit, then when card is dealt ask which stack to place on, or to stay

if they stay or bust, it's the dealer's turn

dealer plays by hitting until all of his stacks have value 17 or more, or he busts.

compare the tally and see who won.

easiest version first, one stack.

deck can be represented as a stack, since cards are dealt from the top.
