#what do modules with __something__ mean
#what is partial doing?
#as expected it is partial function application, it returns a partial object with a function
#expression that has been evaluated along one more axes

#what is a 'ctype' function?

#what is __all__
#there is a function quad_explain, that outputs information about how quad works

#_infunc was confusing at first
#it allows you to define the grid values so as to integrate a 2 demensional function by quadrature
